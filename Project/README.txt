running the app:
FRONT END
install dependencies:
- npm install -g expo-cli
- 


BACK END
install dependencies: 
- flask
- flask-login
- flask-cors
- flask-sqlalchemy
- flask-migrate
format: "pip install <dependency name>", so for example "pip install flask-login" will install flask-login

run the back end code, then front end (we are fetching data from localhost, so you must have the back end and front end code running
at the same time in order for it to work)
